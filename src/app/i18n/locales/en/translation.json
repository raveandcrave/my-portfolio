    "description": "I am a front-end developer with over a year of experience. I like to create convenient and beautiful interfaces. The result of my work brings me real pleasure. I am always open to new knowledge and technologies. I would love to gain experience with Next.js, GraphQL and React Native. In my spare time from development, I enjoy playing the guitar, doing CrossFit and riding a bike. I believe that my personal interests inspire me to be creative and help me find non-standard solutions in my work.",
